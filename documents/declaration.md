**Section 1.

The annual dues and special assessments together with interest, costs and reasonable attorney's fees shall be a personal obligation of the person who was the Owner of such Lot at the time the assessment fell due. Delinquent assessments together with interest, costs and reasonable attorney's fees shall be a lien upon the Lot if the Association files a claim of lien with the King County Recording Office.

Purposes of Assessments.** The assessments levied by the Association shall be used exclusively to promote the recreation, health, safety and welfare of the residents in the Properties and for the capital improvement and/or maintenance of the Common Open Space and facilities, depending upon the stated purpose for which said assessment is levied.

The budget shall also show the anticipated balance (exclusive of any reserves) in the operating fund at the start of such fiscal year which is attributable to operation and maintenance dues for the prior fiscal year which shall be subtracted from the gross operating expenses shown. The net estimated operating revenue so determined shall be assessed to each Owner in the ratio that the number of votes to which each Owner is entitled under Article III hereof bears the total number of entitled votes in the Properties to which the respective assessments apply. In the event the board determines that the estimate of costs and expenses for the current year is, or will become, not sufficient to meet all expenses for any reason, it shall then immediately determine the approximate amount of such shortfall and issue a supplemental estimate of the costs and expenses and determine the revised amount of the operating and maintenance dues payable by each Member, and the date or dates due.

B. Until January 1 of the year following the conveyance of the first Lot to an Owner, the maximum monthly dues shall be $18.00 per entitled vote for each Lot owned by Class A and Class B Members (as provided in Article III).

   1. From and after January 1 of the year immediately following the conveyance of the first Lot to an Owner the maximum annual dues may be increased each year not more than twenty percent (20%) above the maximum assessment for the previous year unless such increase is approved by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of each class of Members.
   2. The Board may fix the annual dues at an amount not in excess of the maximum.

**Section 4. Special Assessment of Emergency Improvements and Capital Improvements.** In addition to the annual dues authorized above, the Association with the approval of fifty-one percent (51%) of each class of Members may levy in any year a special assessment applicable to that year only for the purpose of defraying in whole or in part the cost of any construction, reconstruction, repair or replacement of an emergency improvement and a capital improvement upon the common Open Space or facilities, when such improvements are deemed necessary by the Board. All amounts collected as emergency improvements and capitol improvements assessments may only be used for emergency improvements and capital improvements and shall be deposited by the Board in a separate bank account to be held in trust for such purposes. Said funds shall not be commingled with any other funds of the Association and shall be deemed a contribution to the capital account of the Association by the Members.

**Section 5. Appeals Board.** An appeals board and appeal process shall be established by the Board to mediate and review any appeal regarding disputes arising on any matter relating to the relationship between an Owner and the board of an Owner and the ACC. If such Owner and the Board or ACC cannot reach an agreement by negotiation within thirty (30) days, then the matter shall be referred to the Appeals Board, who shall be designated as follows: The Owner shall choose one Member, provided, that such Owner shall not himself be eligible to serve on the Board; the Board of Directors or ACC shall choose one Member, and the two so chosen shall choose a third.

The decision of the Appeals Board shall be final upon the parties and upon all members of the Association as to the particular issue under appeal, with the losing party bearing the responsibility for whatever, if any, costs where incurred by virtue of the appeal. Nothing contained in this section shall permit enforcement of any decision which is contrary to law or to any prior contractual relation.

**Section 6. Rate of Assessment and Reserve Fund.** Both annual dues and special assessments shall be fixed at equal rates for each vote to which the assessment or dues apply, and shall be paid on a monthly basis.

Written notice of the annual dues and special assessments shall be sent to every Owner subject thereto. The Association shall upon demand and for a reasonable charge furnish a certificate signed by an officer of the Association setting forth whether the annual dues on a specified Lot have been paid. A properly executed certificate of the Association as to the status of annual dues on a Lot is binding upon the Association as of the date of its issuance.

**Section 8. No Offset.** All assessments shall be payable in the amount specified by the assessment and no offsets against such amount shall be permitted for any reason, including, without limitation, a claim that the Association is not properly exercising its duties and powers as provided in the Declaration.

All such insurance shall be written in the name of the Association as trustee for each of the owners.

Such insurance shall run to the benefit of the Association, the respective unit owners, and their respective mortgagees, as their interests may appear.

A. The Board shall utilize every reasonable effort to secure a policy covering physical damage that will provide the following:

1. That the insurer waivers its rights of subrogation of any claims against directors, officers, the managing agent, the individual owners, and their respective household member.

2. That the policy cannot be cancelled, invalidated, or suspended on account of the conduct of any director, officer, or employee of the Association or the managing agent without a prior demand in writing delivered to the Association to cure the defect and the allowance of a reasonable time thereafter within which the defect may be cured.

3. That any "no other insurance" clause contained in this policy shall expressly exclude individual lot Owner’s policies from its operation.

4. That the policy may not be cancelled or substantially modified without at least thirty (30) days’ prior notice in writing to the Board of Directors.

5. An agreed value or amount endorsement and waiver of coinsurance.

6. That the deductible amount per occurrence shall not exceed One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00).

B. In no event shall the insurance coverage obtained and maintained by the Association hereunder be brought into contribution with insurance purchased by individual unit owners or their mortgagees.

C. All public liability and officers' and directors’ liability insurance shall contain a cross liability endorsement.

D. In addition to the insurance required herein above, the Board shall obtain as a common expense:

1. Workmen’s Compensation Insurance if and to the extent necessary to meet the requirements of law.

2. Fidelity bonds covering officers, directors, employees, and other persons who handle or are responsible for handling Association funds. Such bonds shall be in an amount equal to at least one hundred fifty percent (150%) of three months operating expense, and shall contain waivers of any defense based upon the exclusion of persons serving without compensation.

3. Such other insurance as the Board of Directors may determine to be necessary including officers’ and directors’ liability insurance.

E. **Individual Insurance.** By virtue of taking title to a Lot subject to the terms of this Declaration, each Owner covenants and agrees with all other Owners and with the Association that he shall carry an individual homeowner’s policy. Each individual Owner further covenants and agrees that in the event of a partial loss or damage or destruction resulting in less than total destruction, the individual unit Owner shall proceed promptly to repair or reconstruct the damaged structure in a manner consistent with the original construction. In the event that the structure is totally destroyed and the individual Owner determines not to rebuild or to reconstruct, the individual Owner shall clear the Lot of all debris and return it to substantially the natural state in which it existed prior to the beginning of construction.
